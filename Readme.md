Place respawn Markers in the editor, name them respawn_east, respawn_west and/or respawn_guerrila depending on which sides you want to have respawning
The players will respawn here but will not be able to control their units until there are enough of them. Make sure these markers are at least 100 m apart.
Place them somewhere safe, we don't want them to be interfered with, consider framing them with hescos or similar.

Place objects in the editor, name them zsn_respawn_east, zsn_respawn_west and/or zsn_respawn_guerrila.
This is the place the players will be moved to when they are given control back. Make sure they are objects,
I no longer support markers since they cannot be moved during gameplay on dedicated servers. (I recommend the invisible Helipad, but any abject is supported, including vehicles)

[west, 4, -1, true, false] remoteExec ["zsn_waverespawn", 2];

Is the line used to call the script, it contains five params;

Side: the side to use wave respawn, default is West

Wave Size: The number of players to include in each wave, default is 4

Wave count: The max number of waves to respawn, default is -1 (infinite)

Give radio: whether or not to issue squad leader an itemradio, default is true

PvP: whether or not this is a PvP mission, this determines what kind of end trigger will be used when one side runs out of "lives". Default is false

This line can be executed anywhere in the mission at any point, it can be used to change the respawn conditions during gameplay

To initialize the script for multiple sides, just execute the command line multiple times, this example mission executes it three times for three sides.
